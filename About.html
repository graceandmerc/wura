          Epoxy 3D Floor - Everything you need to know
        </h3>

            Among all the Floor Coating Services, Epoxy 3D Floor is gaining
            increasing popularity. Epoxy 3D floor has been used more and more in
            shopping malls, halls, offices, homes and apartments due to its
            creativity and high performance. This is the latest fad in the fancy
            floor world. Epoxy 3D floor installation process involves laying
            down a layer of self-leveling primer followed by the desired image.
            This is then treated with a transparent two-component epoxy or
            polyurethane to give the perfect image depth. A level of protective
            varnish is the final step. Not like a sticker or painted vinyl that
            is directly under your feet, the installed epoxy 3D floor gives the
            perception of depth and is impervious to all sorts of damage that
            would usually affect floor decorations.
